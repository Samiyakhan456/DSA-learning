# 🚀 My DSA Journey: Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my learning log! This repository documents my daily progress in mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms** (DSA).

My goal is to build consistent problem-solving habits, master key patterns, and prepare for technical interviews.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`concepts/`** | Pure logic, theory, and "scratchpad" learning (e.g., implementing raw data structures). |
| **`leetcode/`** | Optimized solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by pattern. |

## 📅 Daily Log

### **Day 1: The Foundation (Jan 1, 2026)**
**Focus:** Array Manipulation & Two Pointers Technique

#### 🧠 Concepts Learned
- **Zero-Indexing:** Computers count from 0.
- **In-Place Swapping:** Reversing data without extra memory ($O(1)$ Space).
- **Two Pointers Pattern:** Using `left` and `right` indices to process a list from both ends.
- **Python Quirk:** Strings are *immutable* and must be converted to lists to modify characters.

#### 💻 Code Written
- `concepts/reverse_array.py`: Basic implementation of the swap logic.
- `leetcode/leetcode_344_reverse_string.py`: Solved **LeetCode 344 (Reverse String)**.
